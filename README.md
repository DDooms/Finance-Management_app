1. Introduction
Purpose
The Personal Finance Management Application is a web-based platform designed to help users manage their finances effectively. It provides a comprehensive set of features for tracking income, expenses, savings, investments, and financial goals. Users can gain insights into their financial habits, set budgets, and visualize their progress toward achieving financial objectives.
Key Features
The application offers the following core features:
•	Income and Expense Tracking: Users can add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions, categorize them by type, attach notes or receipts, and set up recurring transactions.
•	Budgeting and Financial Goals: Users can create, edit, and delete budgets for specific categories or periods, set and track financial goals, and receive alerts when approaching or exceeding budget limits.
•	Savings and Investment Tracking: Users can manage savings and investment accounts, track account balances and transactions, and monitor investment performance and growth.
•	Reporting and Analytics: The application generates visual reports and graphs for income, expenses, savings, and investments, allowing users to filter and sort transactions by various criteria.
2. Architecture
Backend
The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework. It includes controllers, services, repositories, and entity classes to manage financial data. Exception handling is also implemented to provide meaningful error responses.
Frontend
The frontend is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It communicates with the backend via API requests. Material-UI components are used for designing the user interface. User authentication and state management are handled on the frontend.
